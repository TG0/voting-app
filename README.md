# voting-app

Small python3 (finnish speaking) application for collecting named value sets and calculating an average of those (use e.g in voting for a best song / "levyraati").

The info.txt has easy instructions on how to create a single .exe, so you don't need the python3 interpreter to run the app.

See demo video:
